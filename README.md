# ws1000-influxdb-bridge

This is a simple flask app that allows you to load the data submitted by your WS-1000 based weather station into InfluxDB for use with Grafana.

This app is also compatible with the Maplin N23dq WiFi Weather station (this is the station I have, but it's essentially a WS-1000 clone).
